<p><strong class="notranslate">Barcode Scanner+</strong> is not just about <em>receiving</em> information from barcodes out there.
It can also <em>send</em> information, by creating barcodes that others can scan off of your device's screen --
maybe another person with a mobile device like yours. Barcodes can be a convenient way to transfer small
amounts of information between devices.</p>

<h3>Sharing information</h3>

<p>Just press Menu, then choose "Share". On the following screen, you will be able to choose what type of
information you want to share.</p>

<h4>Applications</h4>

<p>For any application on your device, you can generate a barcode that encodes a link into that application's
page in the Android Market. When scanned by another Android device, it will allow the user to quickly download
the application.</p>

<h4>Bookmarks</h4>

<p>Likewise you can choose a bookmark from the device's browers, and share it as a hyperlink encoded in a
barcode. Another device can scan the barcode and then access the hyperlink.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>

<p>Any contact information from your device can be encoded into a barcode. When scanned from another device,
it should allow the user to save that contact into his or her own device's contacts database.</p>

<p>You can choose the <span class="notranslate">vCard</span> format for contact information instead of the default
<span class="notranslate">MECARD</span> format by first pressing Menu.</p>

<h4>Clipboard</h4>

<p>You can encode what is on the device's clipboard at the moment. This will be disabled if the
clipboard is empty.</p>

<h4>Text</h4>

<p>Finally, you can simply type text into the text field at the bottom of the screen. Press the Enter key
to encode.</p>

<h3>Saving generated barcodes</h3>

<p>You can save the barcodes you generate with this application. When viewing the generated barcode on the screen,
press Menu, and then select "Share". As with <a href="history.html">exporting the scan history</a>, you can
then choose a program with which to store or send the image, such as an e-mail application.</p>

<p>The image is saved in PNG format. Note that a copy of the image file is also written to your device's
SD card under a directory called "<code class="notranslate">BarcodeScanner/Barcodes</code>".</p>
