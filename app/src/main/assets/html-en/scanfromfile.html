<p>It is possible to decode a barcode that is stored in an image file on your device, rather than scan
with the device's camera. To do so, press Menu and choose "Decode Image".</p>

<p>You will be prompted to choose an application on your device that handles images, such as the
Gallery application or a file manager. Choose an image file containing a barcode using that application.
You will then return to <strong class="notranslate">Barcode Scanner+</strong>.</p>

<p>If successful, you will see a result screen just as if you had scanned a barcode using the camera.
If not, you will see a short error message.</p>
